# Obsidian_to_Anki
Script to add flashcards from an Obsidian markdown file to Anki.

## Setup
Download the script from the repository. You may wish to consider placing it in a Scripts folder, and adding the script to your PATH.
You'll need to ensure that Anki is running on your desired profile, and that you've installed [AnkiConnect](https://github.com/FooSoft/anki-connect).

Once you've placed the script in the desired directory, run it once with no arguments:
`obsidian_to_anki.py`

This will make a configuration file
