* Have the script check if images are in the media folder first before attempting to add them (saves execution time).
* Once the above is implemented, add a `-i --imageupdate` option to force add images (in case you changed the images and want to see the new versions).
* Figure out how to add support for audio
* Add ability to change default 'Obsidian_to_Anki' tag.
